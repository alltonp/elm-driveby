TODO:
- rename autobuild -> autocompile
- make an autotest.js which compiles app, compiles tests, and runs tests if both compiles succeeds ...
- integrate with elm-test
- serve the app.js under test
- consider making wrapper of phantom as a separate thing ...
- ports or native or both or neither
- how to sequence the steps ...
- so tests will contain the Elm.embed/worker of the test suite ...
- when we execute a command, we send it to JS (with a uid)
- when js responds we reply (with the uid) and update the elm model
- we want these things to be tests ..
- how about wrapping phantomjs in a restful server and have elm call it ...
  ... would that then mean that it could be a package?
- make mounting the app be a command, giving us back a url to use for the test run (put in come context)
- is using rest a way around the ports/native restrictions?
- aim for a single js artifact, and the phantomjs
