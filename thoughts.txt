TODO:
- rename autobuild -> autocompile
- make an autotest.js which compiles app, compiles tests, and runs tests if both compiles succeeds ...
- integrate with elm-test
- we want these things to be tests .. ideally ..
- how about wrapping phantomjs in a restful server and have elm call it ...
  ... would that then mean that it could be a package?
- aim for a single js artifact, and the phantomjs download (jquery is a problem probably)
- move the more scripty stuff into driveby.js ... including autotest features and spawning etc.
- support command stubbing with a response string, json, text etc.
- see if there is a way to save a Virtual Dom to file ...
- more of a testing solution than a webdriver wrapper
